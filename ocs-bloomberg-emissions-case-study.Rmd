## {.disclaimer_block}

**Disclaimer**: The purpose of the [Open Case Studies](https://opencasestudies.github.io){target="_blank"} project is **to demonstrate the use of various data science methods, tools, and software in the context of messy, real-world data**. A given case study does not cover all aspects of the research process, is not claiming to be the most appropriate way to analyze a given data set, and should not be used in the context of making policy decisions without external consultation from scientific experts. 

# **Motivation**
*** 

This case study explores how different countries have contributed to Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions over time and how CO2 emission rates may relate to increasing global temperatures and increased rates of natural disasters and storms. This report provides a basis for the motivation: https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/greenhouse-gases.


CO2 makes up the largest proportion of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States:


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "emissions.jpg"))
```

A variety of sources and sectors contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, with transportation contributing the most metric tons of CO2:


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "sector.png"))
```

So why should we pay attention to greenhouse gases?

According to the [US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 2020 Report](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks): 

> Greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation, thereby trapping heat in the atmosphere and making the planet warmer. The most important greenhouse gases directly emitted by humans include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and several fluorine-containing halogenated substances. Although CO2, CH4, and N2O occur naturally in the atmosphere, human activities have changed their atmospheric concentrations. From the pre- industrial era (i.e., ending about 1750) to 2018, concentrations of these greenhouse gases have increased globally by 46, 165, and 23 percent, respectively (IPCC 2013; NOAA/ESRL 2019a, 2019b, 2019c). 

* IPCC stands for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

There are many signs that our planet is experiencing warmer temperatures:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "warming.png"))
```

The connection between greenhouse gas levels and global temperatures and the influence of increased global temperatures on human health are motivated by these reports:

####

The National Climate Assessment Report states that:

> Heat-trapping gases already in the atmosphere have committed us to a hotter future with more climate-related impacts over the next few decades. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of heat-trapping gases that human activities emit globally, now and in the future.

# **Main Questions**
*** 

#### {.main_question_block}
<b><u> Our main question: </u></b>

1) How have global CO2 emission rates changed over time? In particular for the US, and how does the US compare to other countries? 
2) Are US CO2 emissions, global temperatures, and US storm rates associated? 

####

# **Learning Objectives** 
*** 

In this case study, we will explore CO2 emission data from around the world. We will also focus on the US specifically to evaluate patterns of temperatures and storm activity. This case study will particularly focus on how to use different datasets that span different ranges of time, as well as how to create visualizations of patterns over time. We will especially focus on using packages and functions from the [`Tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}, such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `plotly`and `gganimate`. The tidyverse is a library of packages created by RStudio. While some students may be familiar with previous R programming packages, these packages make data science in R especially efficient.


*** 


We will begin by loading the packages that we will need:

```{r}
library(here)
library(readxl)

library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(ggrepel)
library(RColorBrewer)
```


 Package   | Use

The first time we use a function, we will use the `::` to indicate which package we are using. Unless we have overlapping function names, this is not necessary, but we will include it here to be informative about where the functions we will use come from.


# **Context**
*** 

Greenhouse gas emissions are due to both natural processes and anthropogenic (human-derived) activities. 

These emissions are one of the contributing factors to rising global temperatures, which can have a great influence on [public health](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/understanding-connections-between-climate-change-and-human-health){target="_blank"}  as illustrated in the following image:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "health.png"))
```

> Gases in the atmosphere can contribute to climate change both directly and indirectly. Direct effects occur when the gas itself absorbs radiation. Indirect radiative forcing occurs when chemical transformations of the substance produce other greenhouse gases, when a gas influences the atmospheric lifetimes of other gases, and/or when a gas affects atmospheric processes that alter the radiative balance of the earth (e.g., affect cloud formation or albedo). The IPCC developed the Global Warming Potential (GWP) concept to compare the ability of a greenhouse gas to trap heat in the atmosphere relative to another gas.
The GWP of a greenhouse gas is defined as the ratio of the accumulated radiative forcing within a specific time horizon caused by emitting 1 kilogram of the gas, relative to that of the reference gas CO2 (IPCC 2013). Therefore GWP-weighted emissions are provided in million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MMT CO2 Eq.)


 CO2 is actually the least capable of the greenhouse gases for trapping heat:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "GWP.png"))
```

However, because CO2 is so much more abundant and stays in the atmosphere so much longer than other greenhouse gases, it has been the largest contributor to global warming.

See [here](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/why-does-co2-get-more-attention-other-gases#:~:text=CO2%20sticks%20around,oxide%20(N2O){target="_blank"}.)
for more details.


Furthermore, sizing CO2 levels also influence ocean acidity:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "oceans.png"))
```

This makes it difficult for organisms to maintain their shells or skeletons that are made of calcium carbonate, thus making it more difficult for these organisms to survive and impacting their role in the ecosystem and food chain. 


Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions are believed to influence storm rates. 

Indeed events with high levels of precipitation which can induce flooding and property damage are generally increasing around the country:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "storms.png"))
```


# **Limitations**
*** 

There are some important considerations regarding this data analysis to keep in mind: 

1) The datasets included only include countries and years in which countries were reporting such information to the agencies that collected the data. Thus the data is incomplete. For example while we have a fairly good sense of CO2 emissions globally for later years, additional emissions were also produced by countries that are not included in the data.

2) [Correlation or association does not imply causation](https://dfrieds.com/math/correlation-does-not-imply-causation.html){target="_blank"}. We will be showing how different datasets show similar trends across time. This does not imply that one caused the other. However, in the case of some of the data we will show, there is additional scientific evidence to suggest that for example, increased CO2 emissions may cause increased temperatures or increased rates of disastors. However, simply showing a similar trend over time does not in itself prove that two variables are causally related. As you can see from this plot, often data may show a similar pattern over time by random chance.  See this [website](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations){target="_blank"} for more examples.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "causation.png"))
```




# **What are the data?**
*** 

In this case study we will be using data related to CO2 emissions, as well as other data that may influence, be influenced or relate to CO2 emissions. Most of our data was obtained from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/){target="_blank"}, which is a unique nonprofit that provides a variety of data for free.

In their words, Gapminder is...

> Gapminder is an independent Swedish foundation with no political, religious or economic affiliations. Gapminder is a fact tank, not a think tank. Gapminder fights devastating misconceptions about global development. Gapminder produces free teaching resources making the world understandable based on reliable statistics. Gapminder promotes a fact-based worldview everyone can understand.  Gapminder collaborates with universities, UN, public agencies and non-governmental organizations. All Gapminder activities are governed by the board. We do not award grants. Gapminder Foundation is registered at Stockholm County Administration Board.

To obtain the temperature data, annual average temperatures were selected as shown in this image:
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800 px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "temp.png"))
```


Importantly, notice that the data we would like to use span different time periods:

Data   | Time span

# **Data Import**
*** 

To read in the files that were downloaded from the various sources as indicated in the table above, we will use the `read_xlsx()` and `read_xls()` functions of the `readxl` package to import the data from the .xlsx and .xls files respectively and we will use the `read_csv` function of the `readr` package to import the data from the csv files.

```{r}
# xlsx files:
CO2_emissions <- readxl::read_xlsx(here("docs/yearly_co2_emissions_1000_tonnes.xlsx"))
gdp_growth <- readxl::read_xlsx(here("docs/gdp_per_capita_yearly_growth.xlsx"))
energy_use <- readxl::read_xlsx(here("docs/energy_use_per_person.xlsx"))

# xls file:
mortality <- readxl::read_xls(here("docs/API_SP.DYN.CDRT.IN_DS2_en_excel_v2_804384.xls"))
```

For our csv data files, there are some lines that we would like to not import - infact, we will get an error if we try to import them because our table structure will be as r expects. We can do so using the `skip =` argument of the `read_csv()` function. 

Here you can see that the first two rows of the data about US Disasters doesn't have the same number of columns as the subsequent rows. So we want to skip these first two lines, we will use `skip = 2` for this.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800 px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "Disasters.png"))
```
Now looking at the temperature data, we can see that  the first four lines do not have the same number of columns as the subsequent lines. We will skip importing all 4 lines by using `skip = 4`. We can also specify that `NA` values are encoded as `"-99"`. This will replace all instances of `"-99"` with `NA`. We can do this using the `na = ` argument of the `read_csv()` function. We will do so as: `na = "-99"`. The "-99" needs to be in quotation markes becuase this argument expects characters.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800 px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "tempdata.png"))
```

```{r}
#csv files:
us_disaster <- readr::read_csv(here("docs/time-series-US.csv"), skip = 2)
us_temperature <- readr::read_csv(here("docs/temperature.csv"), skip = 4, na ="-99")
mortality2 <-readr::read_csv(here("docs/mortality.csv"), skip = 5)
```

Great! now we have imported all of the data that we will need.


# **Data Wrangling**
*** 

Now we will take a look at our data and wrangle it until it is easy to use to allow us to evaluate how CO2 emissions have changed over time and how emissions may relate to energy use, mortality, GDP etc. 

### Yearly CO~2~ Emissions

First let's take a look at the CO2 data. We can use the base `slice_head()` function of the `dplyr` package to see just the first rows of our data. We can specify how many rows we would like to see by using the `n =` argument. It is also useful to use the `slice_sample()` function to look at a selection of random rows.

We will use the `%>%` pipe which can be used to define the input for later sequential steps. This will make more sense when we have multiple sequential steps using the same data object. To use the pipe notation we need to install and load  the `dplyr` package.

```{r}
CO2_emissions %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)

CO2_emissions %>%
  slice_sample(n = 10)
```

OK, we can see that our country data makes of the rows and the yearly data makes up the columns. We also see that we have alot of `NA` values.


We can also use the `glimpse()` function of the `dplyr` packge to view our data. This allows us to see more of our data at once. We will see a tiny bit of each variable/column. To do so our data will be displayed with the column names listed on the right.

#### {.scrollable }
```{r}
# Scroll through the output!
CO2_emissions %>%
dplyr::glimpse()
```
####


  Indicator                           n
  <chr>                           <int>
1 CO2 Emissions (Mg)              57246
2 Deaths/1000 People              57246
3 Disasters                          40
4 Energy Use (kg, oil-eq./capita) 57246
5 GDP Growth/Capita (%)           57246
6 Temperature (Fahrenheit)          116


We can see that we have a large [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). A tibble is the tidyverse version of a data frame. It is essentially a table with variable information arranged as columns, and individual observations arranged as rows. We can see that the tibble gives us information about the class of each variable.  For example the `country` variable is made up of character (abbreviated as chr) values. We see that we have 265 different country variables and CO2 emission values for 192 different years (from 1751 to 2014). Recall that the values are emissions in metric tons also called tonnes. We can see that there are fewer `NA` values for later years.

Now we will modify this data to make it more usable for making visualizations. One thing we will use is the `%<>%` opperator which is from the `magrittr` package. This allows us to use our `CO2_emissions` data and reassign it to a modified version at the same time. 

We will use the `pivot_longer()` function of the `dplyr` package to convert our data into what is called long format. This means that we will have more rows and fewer columns than our current format. This is done by collapsing multiple variables into fewer variables.

We want to collapse all of the values for the emission data across the different individual year variables into one new emission variable and we will identify what year they are from using a new `Year` variable.

```{r}
CO2_emissions  %<>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -country, names_to = "Year", values_to = "Emissions")

CO2_emissions %>%
  slice_sample(n = 6)
```

We also want to rename the `country` variable to be capitalized.  We can use the `rename()` function of the `dplyr` package to rename this variable. When renaming variables the new name is listed first before the `=`. We will also modify the `Emissions` data by dividing it by 1000 to make the numbers smaller. To do this we will use the `mutate()` function, which is also part of the `dplyr()` package. This function allows us to create and modify variables. You may also note that the `Year` variable is currently of class type character. We would like to change it to be numeric. This can also be accomplished using the `mutate()` function.

```{r}
  
 CO2_emissions  %<>% 
   dplyr::rename(Country=country) %>%
#   dplyr::mutate(Emissions = Emissions/1000, 
         dplyr::mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year),
          Label = "CO2 Emissions (Metric Tons)")
     #rename(`CO2 Emissions (Mg)`= Emissions)

```

Now let's take a look to see how our data has changed:

```{r}

CO2_emissions %>%
slice_sample(n = 6)

```
Great, we can see that now the `Year` variable is of class double (abbreviated `dbl`), which is a numeric class.

### Yearly Growth in GDP per Capita

```{r}
gdp_growth %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

```{r}
names(gdp_growth)
```

#### {.scrollable}
```{r}
# Scroll through the output!
gdp_growth %>%
glimpse()
```
####

Again, we will use the `pivot_longer()` to transform the data to long format. We will also again change the `country` variable to be `Country` by using the `rename()` function , and we will make the `Year` varaible numeric using the `mutate()` function. 



```{r}
gdp_growth %<>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -country, 
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "gdp_growth") %>%
  rename(Country=country) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year),
         Label = "GDP Growth/Capita (%)") %>%
  rename(GDP = gdp_growth)
```

Now let's see how this data has changed:

```{r}
gdp_growth %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)

gdp_growth %>%
  count(Year)
```

### Energy Use per Person

Now let's take a look at the energy use per person data:

```{r}
energy_use %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

#### {.scrollable}
```{r}
energy_use %>%
  glimpse()
```
####

To wrangle the `energy_use` data, we will again convert the data to long format, rename some variables, and mutate the `Year` data to be numeric.

```{r}
energy_use %<>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -country, 
           names_to = "Year", 
          values_to = "energy_use") %>%
  rename(Country = country) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year),
         Label = "Energy Use (kg, oil-eq./capita)") %>%
  rename(Energy = energy_use)

```


```{r}
energy_use %>%
slice_sample(n = 10)
```


## Crude Mortality Rate

```{r}
mortality %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```


We can see that there are a couple of empty rows which indicate when the data was updated.
We can also see that the columns really start at the 3rd row. So first we will repace the column names with the 3rd row. Then we will remove the first 3 rows.

```{r}
colnames(mortality)
colnames(mortality) <- mortality[3,]
colnames(mortality)
mortality <- mortality[-c(1:3),]
```



#### {.scrollable}
```{r}
mortality %>%
  glimpse()

```
####


That is looking better! However, we also want to remove some variables like: `Country Code`, `Indicator Name`, and `Indicator Code`. We can do that using the `select()` functio of the `dplyr` package. We can use the minus sign `-` to indicate what variables we dont want to keep. Otherwise, we will perform similar modifications as we performed on the other datasets. Note that these variable names need quotation marks around them because they have spaces. 

```{r}
mortality %<>%
  select(-"Country Code",
         -"Indicator Name",
         -"Indicator Code") %>%
  rename(Country = "Country Name") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Country, 
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "Deaths") %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year),
       Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths),
       Label = "Deaths/1000 People")

```

```{r}
mortality %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```


## US-specific Data

Now we will take a look at the US data about disasters and temperature.

### Disasters

```{r}
us_disaster  %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

We are specifically interested in the `Year` and  the variables that contain the word `"Count"` so we will select them using the `select()` and `contains()` functions in the `dplyr` package. Since we are selecting for variables with the word `"Count"` we need to use quotation marks around it. Selecting for the variable `year` does not require this as that is actually the name of one of the existing variables.


```{r}
us_disaster %<>%
           select(Year, contains("Count"))

us_disaster %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

Now we want to create a new variable that will be the sum of all the different types of disasters for each year. 

We can create this ne variable using the `mutate()` function of `dplyr` and we will use the base `rowSums()` function to perform the calculation. We dont want to include the `Year` variable in our sum, so we can exclude it using the `select`function within the `rowSums()` function. However, to do so we need to indicate that we are using the data that we already used as input to our `mutate()` and `rowSums()` functions. We can do so by using a `.`. 


```{r}
us_disaster %<>%
  mutate(`Disasters` = rowSums(select(., -Year))) 

us_disaster %>%
  glimpse()
```

Great, now we are going to remove some of these variables and just keep or select using the `select()` function the variables we are interested in. We will keep the `Flooding Count` becuase as you may recall from earlier in this case study, events of extreme perciptation levels appear to be associated with global warming. We will use this as a proxy for that.

AVOCADO why is US listed in 3 variables?
We are also going to add a new variable called `Country` to indicate that this data is from the United States. This will create a new variable where every value is `United States`. We will also create a new variable called `Region` where every value is `US-specific` and a new variable called `Type` where every value is `United States`.

```{r}
us_disaster %<>%
  dplyr::select(Year,
                Disasters) %>%
  mutate(Country = "United States") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-Country, - Year),
               names_to = "Indicator",
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  mutate(Region = "United States",
           Type = "US-specific",
          Label = "Number of Disasters")

us_disaster %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```



### Temperature

```{r}
us_temperature %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```
OK, so we want to remove the `Anomaly` variable which is an indicator of how different the national average temperature for that year was from the average temperature from 1901-2000 which was 52.02&deg;F. 

We also want to change the date values, which are currently listed as the year followed by the number 12. To do so we want to just keep the first 4 characters in the `Date` variable string values. We can use the `str_sub()` function of the `stringr` package to do this. We just need to indicate the start and stop characters. In this case the start would be 1 and the 4th character would be where we want to stop, so we would use `start = 1, stop = 4`. Again we will create a `Country`, `Region` and `Type` variable. We will also change the name of the `Date` variable to `Year` so that it will be consistent with our other datasets. Furthermore, we also what it to be numeric. We can accomplish both renaming and changing to numeric by using the `mutate()` function. We canthen remove the `Date` variable and also order the columns just like the other us data using the `select()` function.

```{r}
us_temperature %<>%
  dplyr::select(-Anomaly) %>%
  mutate(Date = str_sub(Date, start = 1, end = 4))%>%
  rename() %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Date), 
      Country = "United States",
    Indicator = "Temperature",
       Region = "United States",
         Type = "US-specific",
        Label = "Temperature (Fahrenheit)") %>%
  select(Year, Country, Indicator, Value, Region, Type, Label)

us_temperature %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

# Joining data

Now we would like to join the different datasets together into one tibble. To do so it is often necessary to have at least one column or variable with the same name to be used as a key for putting your data together. To put all of our data together there are several `*_join()` functions available in the `dplyr` package. 


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800 px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "join.png"))
```

We will use the `full_join()` function as we have different time spans for each dataset and we would like to retain as much data as possible. The`full_join()` function will simply create `NA` values for any of the years that are not in one of the data sets. We can check by using the base `summary()` function. This will also allow us to check that there are column names that are consistent in each dataset that we wish to combine.

```{r}
summary(CO2_emissions)
summary(gdp_growth)
summary(energy_use)
summary(mortality)

```

Indeed, `Country`, and `Year` variables are present in all of the datasets. We can see that the minimum and maximum year is different for nearly all the datasets.

We need to specify what columns/variables we will be joining by using the `by =` argument in the `full_join()` function.

```{r}

df_wide <- CO2_emissions %>%
  full_join(gdp_growth, by = c("Country", "Year", "Label")) %>%
  full_join(energy_use, by = c("Country", "Year", "Label")) %>%
  full_join(mortality, by = c("Country", "Year", "Label"))

df_wide %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

We can also do the same thing using by using the`reduce()` function of the `purrr` package. This is a good option if you have many dasasets to combine.


```{r}
df_wide <- list(CO2_emissions, 
                gdp_growth, 
                energy_use, 
                mortality) %>% 
  reduce(full_join, by = c("Country", "Year", "Label"))

df_wide %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

```{r}
df_wide %>%
  glimpse()
```

Nice, looks good!

We will also make a long version of this data, where we will create an new variable called `Indicator` that will indicate what dataset the data came from and we will collapse the values from the columns called ` Emissions` (`CO2 Emissions (Mg)`), `GDP`(`GDP Growth/Capita (%)`), `Energy`(`Energy Use (kg, oil-eq./capita)`), and `Deaths` (`Deaths/1000 People`). 


```{r}
df_long <- df_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-Country, -Year, -Label), 
               names_to = "Indicator", 
               values_to = "Value")
df_long %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

We will also create a new variable called `Region` that will indicate if the data is about the United States or a different country based on the values in the `Country` variable. We will use the `case_when()` function of the `dplyr` package to do this. If the `Country` variable is equal to `"United States"` the value for the new variable will also be "United States", where as if the `Country` variable is not equal to `"United States"` but is some other character string value, such as `"Afghanistan"`, then the value for the new variable will be `"Rest of the World"`.
The new values for the new variable `Region` are indicated after the specific conditional statements by using the `~` symbol. We will also create a new variable called `Type`, where all the values are `"Global"` to indicate that this data is not specific to just the United States. 


```{r}
 df_long %<>%
  mutate(Region = case_when(Country == "United States" ~ "United States",
                            Country != "United States" ~ "Rest of the World"),
         Type = "Global")

df_long %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

We will now combine this data with the US data about disasters and temperatures.

We will now use the `bind_rows()` function which will just append the `us_temperature` data and the `us_disaster` data after the `df_long` data. 


```{r}
us_disaster %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)     
us_temperature %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)    

df_long <-list(df_long, 
               us_disaster,
               us_temperature) %>%
  bind_rows()
df_long$Country <- as.factor(df_long$Country)
```

We can check the top and bottom of the new `df_long` tibble to see that our `us_temperature` data is at the bottom. To see the end of our tibble we can use `slice_tail()` function of the `dplyr` package.

```{r}
df_long %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)

df_long %>%
  slice_tail(n = 6)
```


<details> <summary> Click here for details about the difference between `full_join()` and `bind_rows()` </summary>

The difference between this function and the `full_join()` function is that the `bind_rows()` function will essentially just append each dataset to each other, whereas the `full_join()` function collapses data that is comparable. Here you will see an example of what the data would have been like for `df_wide` if we had made it using `bind_rows()` and if `full_join()` had been used but was not joined by the `Label` variable. Since the `Label` variable had unique values for each type of `Indicator`, this causes the `full_join()` result to be the same as `bind_rows()`. We will specifically look at the values for China in the year of 1980.

```{r}
df_wide_br <- list(CO2_emissions, 
                gdp_growth, 
                energy_use, 
                mortality) %>% 
  bind_rows()


df_wide_fj <- list(CO2_emissions, 
                gdp_growth, 
                energy_use, 
                mortality) %>% 
  reduce(full_join, by = c("Country", "Year"))

df_wide_fj_label <- list(CO2_emissions, 
                gdp_growth, 
                energy_use, 
                mortality) %>% 
  reduce(full_join, by = c("Country", "Year", "Label"))


dim(df_wide_fj)
dim(df_wide_br)

identical(df_wide_fj_label, df_wide_br)

df_wide %>%
  filter(Country == "China", Year == "1980")

df_wide_br %>%
  filter(Country == "China", Year == "1980")
```
</detials>


To remove entries for countries with NA values we can use the `drop_na()` function of the `tidyr` package to drop all years with missing data.

```{r}
df_long_with_miss <- df_long %>%
  arrange(Country)

df_long %<>%
  drop_na() %>%
  arrange(Country)

```

You can see that by removing the NA values the data for Afghanistan starts at 1949 instead of 1751.

```{r}
df_long_with_miss %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)

df_long %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)

```

# **Data Exploration**
*** 
Now we will create some simple plots to examine the data.

We can check the time span of this data by refering back to the  [**What are the data?**] section. To make these plots we will use the `ggplot2` package. The first step in creating a plot is to define what data we intend to use and what data will be ploted on the x-axis, the y-axis, and if any data will be used to determine the color or the fill (also color of plots that have something to fill like a bar plot) or group. All of these are defined using the `aes()` argument, which is short for aesthetic mappings.

First we will take a look at the CO2 emission data.

## CO2 Emissions (1751-2014)

We first need to give the correct data input. We will filter our data to only include the CO2 emissions data by using the `filter()` function of the `dplyr` package. To use this function we need to specify what value we want for a given variable. In this case we want all rows where the `Indicator` variable is equal to the word `Emissions`. Notice that this needs to be in quotes, while the variable name does not.

Then we use the `aes()` argument of the `ggplot()` function to define that our x-axis will be the `Year` variable, the y-axis will be the emission `Value` variable, and that our data should be grouped or separted by the `Country` variable. If we were to stop there we would get a blank plot, as you can see below. We need to add another layer to define how we want the plot to look. We do so by using the `+` sign in between each command. 


```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Emissions") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Country))

```
We will use the `geom_line()` function becuase we would like to create a line plot. There are many `geom_*` functions to choose from that create many different types of plots.

Type `geom` into the RStudio console and you will see many options to scroll through.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800 px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "geom_.png"))
```
Since we have many overlapping lines, we will make our lines slightly transparent by using the `alpha` argument. This takes values from 0 to 1, where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opague. We will also add labels using the `labs()` function. Again, notice that a plus sign is used between each layer that we add to the plot. To make CO2 appear with a subscript we can use `~CO[2]~`. We will also use the function `theme_linedraw()` of `ggplot2` to change the general apearance of the plot. 

Type `theme_` in the RStudio console to see the varios plot theme options available.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800 px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "themes.png"))
```

We will also use the `theme()` function to change the font size of the x-axis, y-axis, axis titles, and the caption as shown below. To know what to call each element of the plot in this function to change the size type `?theme()` in the console. You will see a very large list that includes other plot aspects like the background and the legend. This function can be used to modify your plot to your specifications. We will also use it to remove the legend title by using `element_blank()`. In this case, we are also saving the plot to an object called `co2plot`. To show the plot we simply type the name of the object.

```{r}
co2plot <-df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Emissions") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Country))+
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(title = "Country" ~CO[2]~ "Emissions per Year, 1751-2014",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Emissions (Metric Tons)") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
       legend.title = element_blank())

co2plot
```

Great! We've created our first plot. We can see that many countries show a dramatic increase in emissions over time with a handful of countries with particularly high levels. What about the United States? Which line indicates the emissions in the US? We can add another layer on top of our first plot to add a red line just for the US data. To do this we need to indicate what data we would like to plot, so we need to filter for just the US data and then we need to indicate that it will be colored by Country, even though in this case we only have one line to color. The default color would be a salmon pink color, but we would like red. So we will use the `scale_color_manual()` function to manually choose the color that we want by using `scale_colour_manual(values = c("red"))`. Notice how the color name needs to be in quotes and that the argument `values =` is used to specify what color values to use.

We can add this line to the plot in two ways. The first way is to add the code for this layer to the original code that we used to create the `co2plot` or the second way is to simply add to that plot object by using the `+`.

```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Emissions") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Country))+
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(title = "Country" ~CO[2]~ "Emissions per Year, 1751-2014",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Emissions (Metric Tons)") +
  geom_line(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Emissions",
         Country == "United States"), aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("red")) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
       legend.title = element_blank())

co2plot + geom_line(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Emissions",
         Country == "United States"), aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("red"))
```

It looks like the US has long been the largest CO2 emission producing country until recently, when the US was surpassed by another country. 

Let's figure out which country, by seeing what the top 10 emission producing countries were in 2014. We can do so by filtering the data for 2014, which was the final year of the data. Then we can make a rank variable based on the `Value` variable for the amount of emissions produced. There are many functions in the `dplyr` package for ranking values that are based on the [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL){target="_blank"} [rank functions](https://www.sqlshack.com/overview-of-sql-rank-functions/){target="_blank"}. SQL is another programming language for managing large amounts of data. The difference in the rank functions mostly has to do with how to deal with ties in the data.  We will use `dense_rank()`, as we do not want gaps between ranks.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600 px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "rank.png"))
```

We want to do this in descending order becuase we want to rank by largest to smallest, so we will use the `desc()` function of the `dplyr` package. Then we will arrange the output by rank using the `arrange()` function of the `dplyr` package. 

```{r}

top_10_count <-df_long %>%
    filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
    filter(Year==2014) %>%
    mutate(rank=dense_rank(desc(Value))) %>%
    filter(rank<=10) %>%
    arrange(rank)

top_10_count

```
We can see that China is now the top emission producing country.


Let's make a plot of these top countries. We need to filter the data to just these top countries by using the `%in%` opperator to only keep countries in our`Country` variable that are also in the `Country` variable within `top_10_count`. We can use the `pull()` function also fo the `dplyr` package to specifically grab just the `Country` data out of `top_10_count`.


Since we have 10 countries we will want to differentiate them by color. 

To color our plot we will use the viridis color pallette which is compatible with color-blindness by using the `scale_fill_viridis_d()` function which is simply available by loading the `ggplot2` package. There are a few variations such as discreet as `_d`, or binned continuous as `_b`, or continuous scale as `_c`. See [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html) for more information.


```{r}

Top10b<-df_long %>%
  filter(Country %in% pull(top_10_count, Country)) %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year>=1900) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()+
  theme_linedraw() + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 Emissions-producing Countries in 2010 (1900-2014)",
       subtitle = "Ordered by Emissions Produced in 2014",
       y = "Emissions (Metric Tons)",
       x = "Year")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))

Top10b

```

It's still a bit difficult to tell which line corresponds to which country. So, let's add a label. One way to do this is to add text layer to our plot using the `geom_text()` function of the `ggplot2` package. We need to first specify what data we will use, in this case we will filter for just the data for the last year (which we can do using the `last()` function of the `dplyr` package) and then we need to indicate that our label will be based on the `Country` variable using the `aes()` asthetics mapping argument. We will also get rid of our legend since we will not need it anymore, by using the `theme()` function of the `ggplot2` package.

```{r}

Top10b +
geom_text(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Country %in% pull(top_10_count, Country)) %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year == last(Year)), aes(label = Country)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Not bad, but some of the labels are overlapping and difficult to read. We can use the `check_overlap = TRUE` argument within the `geom_text()` function to remove overlapping variables and we can expand the plot area horizontally so that the names are not cutoff by using `scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.2,0))`.

```{r}

Top10b +
geom_text(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Country %in% pull(top_10_count, Country)) %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year == last(Year)), aes(label = Country), check_overlap = TRUE) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.2,0))+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

This is easier to read now, but it also causes us to lose some of the labels. 
There are several alternative ways we can keep all of our labels and make them easier to read. The first package we will show is called `directlabels`.

The most simple option is to use the `direct.label()` function. which will automatically add lables at the end of the lines. However, it is a bit difficult to see some of our labels as they get automatically sized to fit the plot.




```{r}
library(directlabels)
direct.label(Top10b) +scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.3,0))
```

Alternatively this can be done in a more `ggplot2` layering method by using the `geom_dl()` function.

```{r}

Top10b +scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.3,0)) +
     geom_dl(aes(label = Country), method = list("last.bumpup")) +
     theme(legend.position = "none")
```

This is nice and legible now. We have all 10 countries names listed and they are in order of the last data point and they are relatively close to the lines that they correspond to. 

Another option is to use a different method in the `directlables` package. [Here](http://directlabels.r-forge.r-project.org/docs/index.html){target="_blank"} is a list of options.

The `"angled.boxes"` method looks nice for some plots but doesn't work very well for our plot:
```{r}
direct.label(Top10b, method = list("angled.boxes"))+scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.3,0)) 
```

However the `"last.polygons"` method works quite well:
```{r}
direct.label(Top10b,method = list("last.polygons"))+scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.3,0))
```
The second package is the `ggrepel` package which is especially good for crowded labels that might overlap one another. It alows for more control than the `directlabels` package. We will use the `geom_text_repel()` function. Just like with `geom_text`, first we need to specify what data we want to include. We then specify with the `aes()` argument that our label will be based on the `Country` variable and we again specify what variable to use for our x axis and y axis, so that we indicate where the labels should be plotted. 

```{r}

Top10b + geom_text_repel(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Country %in% pull(top_10_count, Country)) %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year == last(Year)),
            aes(label = Country,
                x = Year,
                y = Value)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.3,0))

```
You can see that this package creates segments that connect the label to the line.

There are many arguments to use to style your labels just the way that you want:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600 px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "ggrepel.png"))
```

See [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggrepel/vignettes/ggrepel.html){target = "blank"} for more details.


```{r}

Top10b + geom_text_repel(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Country %in% pull(top_10_count, Country)) %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year == last(Year)),
            aes(label = Country,
                x = Year,
                y = Value),
            nudge_x = 10,
              hjust = 1,
              vjust = 1,
       segment.size = 0.25,
              force = 1)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.3,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.3,0))

```
Nice, that looks pretty good.

Now let's try showing our data in a different way. This time we will create a `geom_tile` plot.
To color our plot we will use the viridis color pallette again  but this time we will use the `scale_fill_viridis_c()`, recall that the `_c` indicates a continuous scale. See [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html) for more information.  Again, we will filter our data to include only the Countries included in the `Country` variable of the `top_10_count`. Recall that the `pull()` function specifically  grabs the `Country` variable data values within `top_10_count`. Then we will use the `fct_reorder()` function of the `forcats` package to order our countries based on the last emission value in 2014. 

To use this function, the variable that is to be reordered is listed first, then the variable that is being used to determine the order, followed by a function to determine the order, in this case the last value using the `last()` function (recall that this is also a function of the `dplyr` package).

```{r}
Top10<-df_long %>%
  filter(Country %in% pull(top_10_count, Country)) %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year>=1900)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=fct_reorder(Country, Value, last))) +
  geom_tile( aes(fill=log(Value))) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1900,2014,by=5),
                     labels = seq(1900,2014,by=5)) + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 "~CO[2]~"Emission-producing Countries in 2014",
    subtitle = "Ordered by Emissions Produced in 2014",
        fill = "Ln(CO2 Emissions (Metric Tons))") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 90),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.title = element_blank(),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.position = "bottom")

Top10

```
We can also create this plot directly without using the `top_10_count` tibble, by creating a new variable for the last value that we will call `last_val`, or in other words the emission value in 2014 for each country. To do this we need to first use the `group_by()` function of the `dplyr` package to make sure that the last value is calculated and repeated for each row for a given country. Here you can see that that is the case for Afghanistan.
```{r}

df_long %>%
  #filter(Type=="Global") %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year>=1900) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate(last_val = last(Value))
```

Now we will also create a `rank` variable like we did when we created `top_10_count` that will be calculated as the rank of the countries based on the `last_val` value (again this is the emission value in the last year of the data, 2014). Now we want to ungroup our data, as we want the rank to be calculated across the countries.     

```{r}

df_long %>%
  filter(Type=="Global") %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year>=1900) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate(last_val = last(Value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(rank=dense_rank(desc(last_val))) %>%
  filter(rank<=10) 
```

Now we can put it all together to create the plot directly from `df_long`.

```{r}

Top10<-df_long %>%
  filter(Type=="Global") %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Emissions") %>%
  filter(Year>=1900) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate(last_val = last(Value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(rank=dense_rank(desc(last_val))) %>%
  filter(rank<=10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=fct_reorder(Country, Value, last))) +
  geom_tile( aes(fill=log(Value))) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1900,2014,by=5),
                     labels = seq(1900,2014,by=5)) + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 "~CO[2]~"Emission-producing Countries in 2014",
    subtitle = "Ordered by Emissions Produced in 2014",
        fill = "Ln(CO2 Emissions (Mg))") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 90),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.title = element_blank(),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.position = "bottom")

Top10
```
We can see that Germany had very low emission rates at the end of World War II. We see that the US has consistently had high emission rates since 1900, but that the emission rates in China recently surpased that of the US. The portions of the plot that are white indicate that there is no emission data for that country.

Now let's take a look at the data in slightly different way. Let's look at overall global emissions by calculating a sum each year of all the emission values for the different countries. Note that this is limited to only the countries included in the dataset. 

To calculate this value we will first use the `group_by()` function of the `dplyr` package. This will allow our calcluation to be performed on aggregated data by the different values for the `Year` variable. Otherwise, we would simply get a sum of overall emissions across all of the years in the data set.

Then we will use the `summarize()` function (also of the `dplyr` package) and the base `sum()` function to calculate a sum of the emission values each year.

Since we will be ploting only one value each year, we do not need to assign a `group` in the `aes()` argument. this time we will make the size of the line that will be plotted a bit larger using the `size()` argument in the `geom_line()` function.

```{r}
CO2_world<-df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Emissions") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(Value = sum(Value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + 
  labs(title = "World "~CO[2]~" Emissions per Year , 1751-2014",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries", 
           y = "Emissions (Metric Tonnes)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))
CO2_world

```

Ok, we can now clearly see that global CO2 emissions have dramatically risen since 1900.

## Yearly Growth in GDP per Capita (1801 to 2019)

Now we will take a look a GDP growth of various countries

```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "GDP") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Country)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(title = "Country GDP Growth per Capita per Year (Annual %), 1801-2019",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "GDP Growth per Capita (Annual %)") +
  geom_line(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "GDP",
         Country == "United States"), aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("red")) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
       legend.title = element_blank())
```
We can see that the variation in GDP has become greater over time.

```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "GDP",
         Year >= 1801) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = "Mean Country GDP Growth per Capita per Year (Annual %), 1801-2019",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries", 
           y = "GDP Growth per Capita (Annual %)") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))
```

## Energy Use per Person (1960 to 2015)

```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Energy") %>%
ggplot(aes(x=Year, y= Value, group=Country)) +
  geom_line(alpha=0.2) + 
  geom_line(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Energy",
           Country == "United States"), aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("red")) +
  labs(title = "Country Energy Use (kg of Oil Equivalent per Capita), 1960 to 2015",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries", 
           y = "Energy Use (kg of Oil Equivalent per Capita)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 15),
       legend.title = element_blank())
```

Let's see who the top countries are. First let's take a look at the year 2000, and then 2014.

```{r}

df_long %>%
filter(Indicator == "Energy") %>%
  filter(Year == 2000) %>%
 slice_max(Value, n = 10)


df_long %>%
filter(Indicator == "Energy") %>%
  filter(Year == 2014) %>%
  slice_max(Value, n = 10)

```


```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Energy") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Value = sum(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  
  labs(title = "Worldwide Energy Use (kg of Oil Equivalent per Capita), 1960 to 2015",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Energy Use (kg of Oil Equivalent per Capita)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 15))
```

## Crude Mortality Rate


```{r}

Mortality <-df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Deaths") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value, group=Country)) +
  geom_line(alpha=0.2) + 
  geom_line(data =df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Deaths",
         Country == "United States",
              Year >= 1960, 
              Year <= 2019), aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("red")) +
  labs(title = "Country Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons), 1960 to 2019",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
       legend.title = element_blank())

Mortality

```

Let's take a look to see which countries account for the large peaks in Morality in the late 1970s and the early 1990s. It's always a good idea to check your data if you see anomolies like this. 

```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Deaths", Year == 1978) %>% slice_max(Value, n = 3)
```

Looks like Cambodia is the country with the large peak in the late 1970s. If you look up the history of Cambodia during this time period, you will see that the peak we are seeing makes sense because Cambodia experienced [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Civil_War){target = "blank"} and [genicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide){target = "blank"} during this time. 

```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Deaths", Year == 1993) %>% slice_max(Value, n = 3)
```
Rwanda is the country with the peak in the early 1990s. This also makes sense because Rwanda experienced a [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Civil_War){target = "blank"} at this time. 

What about now? What countries have the highest rates?

```{r}
df_long %>%
   filter(Indicator == "Deaths", Year == 2017) %>% slice_max(Value, n = 10)
```
It seems that many eastern european countries currently have the highest mortality rates, as well as [Lesotho](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/136910/ccsbrief_lso_en.pdf;jsessionid=227D2B563F133AE2054046887D2D905D?sequence=1){target = "blank"}.

Let's make a plot of just these countries:
```{r}
Mortality <-df_long %>%
  filter(Type=="Global") %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Deaths") %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate(last_val = last(Value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(rank=dense_rank(desc(last_val))) %>%
  filter(rank<=5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_viridis_d()+
  labs(title = "Country Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons), 1960 to 2019",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
       legend.title = element_blank())

direct.label(Mortality, method = list("angled.boxes"))



```
With the exception of Losotho, we can see that the mortality rate appears to be steadily increasing in these countries. 

What countries have the lowest reported rates? We can simply alter our plot code to not use the descinding value to rank mortality. 

```{r}
Mortality <-df_long %>%
  filter(Type=="Global") %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Deaths") %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate(last_val = last(Value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(rank=dense_rank(last_val)) %>%
  filter(rank<=5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_viridis_d()+
  labs(title = "Country Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons), 1960 to 2019",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
       legend.title = element_blank())

direct.label(Mortality, method = list("angled.boxes")) + scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.3,0))



```
Looks like many countries in the Persian Gulf region have the lowest rates of mortality. 

Let's make a plot of some of the countries that showed unusal patterns over time. We will include the US for comparison.

```{r}

df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Deaths",
            Country %in% c("United States", "Rwanda", "Cambodia", "Qatar", "Bulgria"))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = " Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons), 1960 to 2019",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))
```

We can make a similar plot where each country is shown side by side by using the `facet_grid()` function of the `ggplot2` package. We need to indicate what variable we would like to use to group the data by and indicate it with this symbol `~`.

```{r}

df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Deaths",
            Country %in% c("United States", "Rwanda", "Cambodia", "Qatar", "Bulgaria"))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_grid(~ Country)+
  labs(title = " Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons), 1960 to 2019",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))
```



```{r}
df_long %>%
  filter(Type=="Global") %>%
  filter(Indicator=="Deaths") %>%
  filter(Year == 2014) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate(last_val = last(Value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(rank=dense_rank(desc(last_val)))%>%
  filter(Country == "United States")

```

The US ranked 83 out of 253 countries. This means that 70 % of the countries included had lower mortality rates.




Let's see what the overall trend in mortality has been over time.
```{r}

df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Deaths") %>%
   group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.4) + 
  labs(title = "Mean Country Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons), 1960 to 2018",
     caption = "Limited to reporting countries",
           y = "Crude Mortality Rate (per 1000 Persons)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))
  
```
We can see that despite some countries with different patterns of mortality, overall the world has exprienced much lower rates of mortality than in previous decades.


## US Disasters

```{r}

df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Disasters",
              Year >= 1980, 
              Year <= 2019) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value, group=Country)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(title = "US Disasters, 1980 to 2019",
    subtitle = "Drougths, Floods, Freezes, Severe Storms. Tropical Cyclones, Wildfires, and Winter Storms", 
           y = "Disaster Count")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))
  
```

## US Temperature

```{r}

df_long %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Temperature",
              Year >= 1895, 
              Year <= 2019) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Value, group=Country)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(title = "US Average Annual Temperature, 1895 to 2019",
           y =  "Temperature (Fahrenheit)")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))

```


# **Data Visualization**
*** 

Now Let's try putting the data together. 

```{r,fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
ggplot(df_long, aes(x=Year, y=Value, group=Country)) +
  geom_line(alpha=0.2) + 
  geom_line(data = df_long %>%
  filter(Country == "United States"), aes(x=Year, y=Value, color = Country)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("red")) +
  facet_wrap(Indicator~., scales = "free_y",strip.position="right", ncol = 1) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Indicators by Year and Value", 
       y = "Indicator Value")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16))
```

This looks a bit awkward, because the eacy type of data spans a different time spans.

## Time spans of data

Let's take a look at the reporting countries for each year for each type of data.

```{r}
dataspan2 <-df_long %>%
   filter(Indicator != "Disasters" &
          Indicator != "Temperature") %>%
  group_by(Year, Label, .drop=FALSE) %>%
  tally() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= Year, y = n, color = Label)) +
  geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 1980, linetype=2, color="black") +
   geom_vline(xintercept = 2014, linetype=2, color="black") +
  labs(title = "Countries with Complete Data per Year",
    subtitle = "Global Data", 
           y = "Countries") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1750,2020,by=10),
                     labels = seq(1750,2020,by=10)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 90),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
       axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
       plot.caption = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
       legend.title = element_blank())
```

We can see that all of our data spans from 1980 to 2014.

```{r}
